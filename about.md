Hi, I'm Vladislav Kochetov!

I'm a **Software Engineer** with a strong passion for **Mobile development**, particularly in Android applications. I love exploring new technologies and building projects that push the boundaries of what's possible on mobile platforms. In addition to Android, I'm always diving into little side projects that expand my knowledge in various areas of software development.

I’m [@vladleesi](https://github.com/vladleesi) on social media, sharing thoughts on development, tech, and more.

More about [my career is here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladkochetov/).

I have a wife and an ultra-cute Golden Retriever dog. In my free time, I love video games, and playing drums as a hobby. We've lived in both Russia and Mexico, and now I’m preparing for a new chapter as I get ready to move to the USA with my EB-2 NIW visa.
