Hi, I'm Vladislav Kochetov!

I’m a **Software Engineer** with 8+ years of experience and a deep focus on **Android** development.
I care a lot about code quality, developer experience, and building mobile products that are both scalable and pleasant
to work on.
Most of my day-to-day work revolves around Android and Kotlin, but I regularly explore new technologies through side
projects - mainly to sharpen my thinking and stay curious beyond the mobile bubble.

You can find more details about my professional background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladkochetov/),  
or download my resume [here](/assets/resume/Vladislav_Kochetov_Android_Engineer_Resume.pdf).

Outside of work, I share life with my wife and an ultra-cute Golden Retriever.  
I unwind with video games and play drums purely for fun.  
We’ve lived in both Russia and Mexico, and I’m now getting ready for the next chapter -  
relocating to the United States under the **EB-2 NIW** program.
